Hey,This is BanTianZhong, from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.


#### ABOUT THIS BLOG


Follow this blog, you may see related technical discussions about Python, Django, Web crawler, algorithms, data analysis, machine learning, etc. I may also share some learning and life trivia here.

Itâ€™s awkward to say, I learned programming for almost five years old, but there are no achievements to show. There are only a few learning codes for your reference: [My GitHub](https://github.com/HalfClock)
